## Description:

With this game, you and a minimum of three friends can play and try to dominate the map. The person whom creates the server can setup the host and add the initial three or more players as well as set the map. After the creation of the server, the host is the only one who can add/remove players and change the game settings. While in the game players have full control on what they want to do has well as how they go to accomplish it, but there are some limitation which is seen in the game. One thing to note is that even though the host can't play the game they have the power of adding obstacles into the game that can dramatically change the outcome of who wins, so make sure you plan on every situation you can come across.

## How To Play

This is a round based game where every player will pass in their turn to the host at the end of each round. The host does not play the game but they do update the map accordingly to what each person does and they will read out a general summary of the actions taken by the players after the end of each round (excluding successful espionage). The host can also send out a random event for each player, these can be very minor as a new hit film to as major as a mass revolution. Each turn made by the players consists of 4-6 actions per round. These can consists of things from building farms, industries, and military to invading your neighbor or making trade deals and sponsoring rebels. The first person to take over the map wins!
